"""One action, one verdict — whichever surface saw it.

Prismor's claim is that a single policy governs every enforcement point. That
claim is only worth making if it is checked: the surfaces normalize from very
different payloads (a Claude hook envelope, an MCP JSON-RPC frame, an SDK tool
wrapper, an HTTP body), and nothing except a test stops one of them from
quietly shaping an event the rules no longer match.

So each case below is expressed once and then replayed through every surface
that can carry it, asserting the same rule fires with the same verdict. A drift
here is a real coverage hole: the same `rm -rf /` blocked on Claude and allowed
through the gateway.
