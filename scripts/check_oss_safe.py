"""OSS-safety guard for the public Prismor runtime repo.

Prismor is open-core: the runtime + adapters + rule format are public, while the
control plane, the Ed25519 signing **private key**, and the curated premium
threat feed stay proprietary. A single accidental commit of the private key or a
secret would collapse the signing moat — so this guard fails the build if any
must-never-ship material is tracked in the public repo.

It scans the set of git-tracked files (or an explicit list) for:
  * private key material (PEM private-key headers, *.pem / *.key files)
  * obvious cloud/credential secrets (AWS keys, generic API tokens)
  * an explicit path denylist (e.g. keys/private.pem, the signing key env)

Exit code 0 = clean, 1 = a violation was found (CI fails). Zero third-party
dependencies — stdlib only — so it runs anywhere, including as a pre-commit hook.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/check_oss_safe.py            # scan all git-tracked files
    python3 scripts/check_oss_safe.py a.py b.txt # scan an explicit list
