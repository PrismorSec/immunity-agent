"""Hermes transcript adapter.

Hermes writes session records under ``$HERMES_HOME/sessions/*.jsonl``. Its
plugin emits camelCase payloads — ``hookEvent`` / ``toolName`` / ``toolInput``
— which `hooks._normalize_hermes` consumes directly, so records replay with no
key rewriting.

``hookEvent`` values seen from the plugin: ``before_tool_call`` (the default and
the only pre-action gate), ``message_received`` (user input) and
``message_sending`` (agent output, post-action and therefore skipped).

**Verification status:** unlike the Claude and Codex adapters, this one has not
been run against real Hermes transcripts — no Hermes session data was available
when it was written. It is tested against fixtures derived from
`_normalize_hermes`'s contract. Treat a zero-payload sweep on a non-empty
Hermes store as a format mismatch to report, not as "nothing happened"; run
with ``--strict`` to make that fail loudly.

Files that already contain normalized Prismor events (rather than plugin
payloads) remain served by the pre-existing ``prismor ingest --input`` path,
which is unchanged.
