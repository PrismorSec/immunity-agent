"""Turn a shadow-AI finding into the action that governs it.

``prismor discover`` answers "what is running that Prismor does not govern".
This module answers the only follow-up that matters: make it governed.

There is exactly one way to govern an agent Prismor is not hooked into, and it
is not to constrain it — every enforcement surface in the runtime (egress
screening, the Docker sandbox, tool denies, kill switches) sits downstream of a
hook payload, so an unhooked agent produces no event and nothing to act on.
Governing shadow AI therefore means *eliminating the shadow*: install the hook,
move the MCP server behind the gateway, vault the key.

Three levers, one per surface:

    agent       hooks.install_hooks          — shadow agent becomes governed
    mcp         mcp_gateway.install_gateway  — servers move behind the gateway
    credential  cloaking.add_env_secrets     — the key becomes a placeholder

Everything this module cannot fix is reported as *skipped with a reason*, never
silently dropped. A remediation tool that quietly does less than it claims is
worse than one that does nothing, because the report is what the operator then
believes.
