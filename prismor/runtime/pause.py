"""Local pause/resume for the Prismor runtime.

`prismor pause` suspends local ENFORCEMENT only, WITHOUT uninstalling the
hooks — observe-mode screening/telemetry keeps running as normal, so nothing
goes dark. Auto-resumes after 24h (or a custom `--for` window) unless started
via `prismor pause-hard`, which pauses indefinitely until `prismor resume`.
A lightweight heartbeat keeps emitting the whole time so the control plane
shows the machine as *paused* — a deliberate, attributable state — rather
than letting it silently go idle, which is the failure mode of just deleting
the hooks (indistinguishable from a closed laptop).

State lives in a single JSON marker at ``~/.prismor/pause.json``, mirroring the
revocation-marker pattern in ``enterprise/identity.py``. A ``--for`` window
makes the pause self-expire (checked on the hot path in :func:`active_state`),
so protection heals itself even if ``prismor resume`` is never run.
