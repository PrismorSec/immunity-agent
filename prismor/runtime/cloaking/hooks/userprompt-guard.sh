# Prismor — cloaking UserPromptSubmit hook (soft-block).
#
# Scans the user's submitted prompt for recognizable secret patterns. On a
# match, auto-cloaks the value (writes it to $PRISMOR_SECRETS_DIR with a
# hashed name) and BLOCKS the prompt with a reason that shows the sanitized
# version. The user copies the sanitized prompt and resubmits — from that
# point forward, the model only ever sees the `@@SECRET:auto_xxxxxx@@`
# placeholder, never the raw value.
#
# UserPromptSubmit hooks cannot rewrite the prompt (Claude Code exposes only
# block/add-context on this event). To avoid a manual re-paste, the sanitized
# prompt is STASHED under $PRISMOR_HOME/prompt_stash/<session_id> when we
# block; on the user's next (clean) prompt in that session the stash is
# auto-loaded via `additionalContext` and then deleted, so the model receives
# the sanitized request without the user ever copying it. Any follow-up
# message ("go", "continue", a clarification) triggers the reload.
#
# Stdin:  Claude Code UserPromptSubmit JSON payload
# Stdout: JSON with decision=block and a reason (if a secret was detected),
#         JSON with hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext (if a stashed
#         sanitized prompt is being reloaded), or empty (no-op) otherwise.
