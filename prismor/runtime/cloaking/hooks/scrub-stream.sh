# Prismor — cloaking output scrubber (stdin filter).
#
# Reads every registered secret from $PRISMOR_SECRETS_DIR and rewrites any
# occurrence of a real value on stdin to its `@@SECRET:name@@` placeholder,
# streaming the result to stdout. Used by decloak.sh to sanitize the combined
# stdout/stderr of *every* Bash command the model runs — so a secret that a
# command reads out of a file (grep, cat, source+echo, an HTTP response body,
# etc.) is masked before Claude Code records the output, even when the model
# never referenced an `@@SECRET@@` placeholder.
#
# Why a separate script instead of an inline `sed` in the wrapped command:
# the real secret values must NOT appear in the command string, or they would
# land in `tool_input.command` (and thus the transcript). This helper reads
# the vault itself at runtime, so only its path — never a secret — is embedded
# in the command Claude Code records.
#
# Stdin:  arbitrary command output.
# Stdout: same output with registered secret values replaced by placeholders.
# On any error (missing vault, no jq/sed) it passes stdin through unchanged:
# a scrub is best-effort defense-in-depth and must never swallow command
# output the agent depends on.

# eligible if >= 16 chars, or >= 8 chars AND carrying a digit, a symbol, or
# mixed case. A short single-case word is skipped — masking it would corrupt
# ordinary output far more than it protects anything.

# Slurp stdin, then replace every registered secret value with its placeholder
# using bash's literal substring substitution (${var//"needle"/repl}).

# We deliberately do NOT use sed here. sed treats the value as a regex, so a
# secret containing regex metacharacters ([ ] ( ) { } . * + ? ^ $ |) either
# made sed abort with "unterminated substitute pattern" — dropping the whole
# command's output — or, worse, silently mangled the text. Quoting the needle
# in ${var//"$real"/...} forces a literal match, immune to any byte a secret
# key can contain, and it also spans newlines (sed only scrubs line-by-line).
#
# The `; printf x` / `%x` dance preserves trailing newlines that command
# substitution would otherwise strip.
