"""Local-host AI discovery — find agents on this machine Prismor doesn't govern.

Prismor already inventories the agents that run through its hooks
(``agents.list_agents``). That misses the ones nobody wired up: a Claude Code
or Codex install sitting on the machine with no Prismor hooks, quietly making
tool calls Prismor never sees. This module sweeps the host for those.

For each supported agent it answers three questions from files already on disk:

  * **present**  — is the agent's config or CLI on this machine?
  * **governed** — are Prismor hooks wired into that config?
  * **seen**     — has the agent actually run through Prismor (in the registry)?

An agent that's present and *not* governed is the finding: shadow AI tooling
outside Prismor's coverage. The sweep is read-only and host-local. It does not
touch the network — that's a separate, heavier project. It reuses the config
locations `scanner.py` already knows and the registry `agents.py` maintains.
