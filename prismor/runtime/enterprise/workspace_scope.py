"""Per-workspace scoping — managed (org-governed) vs local-only (personal).

The privacy/UX model that lets Immunity not hinder developers while keeping
security followed:

* **Local protection is always on.** Every workspace gets Prismor's default +
  project policy — destructive commands, secret exfiltration, etc. are blocked
  locally regardless of scope. A developer can NOT turn the security floor off by
  calling a repo "personal".
* **The org claims its repos by pattern** (e.g. ``github.com/acme/*``), served in
  the signed org policy. A workspace whose git remote matches a claimed pattern
  is **org-managed**: org telemetry flows and the org policy overlay applies, and
  the developer cannot downgrade it — company/client code stays governed.
* **Everything else is the developer's personal space** — **local-only**: Prismor
  still protects them, but nothing is reported to any org and no org policy
  applies. A developer may explicitly opt a non-claimed repo into managed.

Concretely, "managed" gates two things at the runtime: the org policy overlay
merge (see policy_engine) — which also carries the org telemetry sink — and the
per-call heartbeat (see cli hook-dispatch). Personal workspaces therefore emit
no findings, no volume, and apply no org policy; the org never sees them.

**Deployed workloads.** Scope is inferred from the git remote, which a container
or CI runner does not have. With no remote and an org that claims patterns, such
a workspace falls through to local — correct for a laptop, silently wrong for a
production agent that reports nothing and says so nowhere. ``PRISMOR_WORKSPACE_SCOPE``
settles it explicitly (``managed`` | ``personal``) for exactly that case: it is
read from the environment, so it needs no writable ``$PRISMOR_HOME``, and it is
ranked below an org-claimed pattern — a deployment cannot use it to downgrade a
repo the org claims.
